# Caracal Docker Images

This repo serves to build [Caracal](https://github.com/crytic/caracal) docker images for each [Scarb](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb) version counting 2.0.0 upwards.

If a certain image is not working, please open an issue. This repo might be deprecated once caracal starts building docker images and [Cairo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo) becomes more stable.
